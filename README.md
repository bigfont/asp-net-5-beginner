# asp-net-5-then-to-now

This repo contains the notes and source code for a beginner level presentation on ASP.NET 5.

# Audience

People who already know C#, ASP.NET and .NET and are beginners in ASP.NET Core.

# Overview

This talk covers the why and how of ASP.NET Core. We will briefly trace the history of ASP.NET by examining the reasons behind key features of major releases. Next, we will inspect the anatomy of a typical ASP.NET Core application. What has changed? What is the same? What does each bit do? Finally, we will build up from an empty ASP.NET Core application to show how each part contributes to a leaner, faster, more portable deployment.
